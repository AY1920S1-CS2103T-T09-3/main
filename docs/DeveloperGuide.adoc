== Introduction

ClerkPro is an appointment and queue management system targeted at clerks working in small clinics.
This developer guide is organised in a top-down approach, beginning with the Architecture Design.
You may jump to any section by clicking on the heading in the contents page.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of ClerkPro. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `SystemCommandParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
    * A `Command` object can be classified as one of two types, a `ReversibleCommand` and a `NonActionableCommand`.
    * A `ReversibleCommand` refers to any command which modifies the data in the system's model.
        To enable the user to revert their changes, the actions of such commands needs to be reversible.
    * Conversely, a `NonActionableCommand` only reads data from the system's model without modifying it.

.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient).
    *  If the user intends to execute a reversible command, a `ReversibleActionPairCommand` is created and pushed into an undo stack.
        This action pair command contains a pairing of of the action itself and its inverse.
        (e.g. Pairing 'add person A' and 'delete person A' command).
    *  If the user intends to execute a `NonActionableCommand`, the command will be directly executed.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

. Handles the mutli-threading of reactive search requests by the user.
    * When the user is searching for an existing entry, the system will attempt to filter through the results as the user types.

    * Each key stroke will trigger a new reactive search request which is processed on a separate thread.
        This is done to avoid lagging the UI.

    * If a new reactive search request is triggered before the previous request has been completed.
        The previous request thread will be interrupted before the new request thread is allowed to be executed.

    * The execution of a reactive search differs from the normal command, in the way that it only allows the execution of `NonActionableCommand` types.
        Hence, there is no modification of any data in the system's model when executing a reactive search.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelOverviewClassDiagramV2.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

==== Overall Model component
The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.

* consists of 3 sub-components: Queue Manager, Address Book and Appointment Book.

* stores the details of patients and staff in 2 separate instances of Address Book.

* stores the patients' appointment details and duty shifts of staff doctors in 2 separate instances of Appointment Book.

* allows for code reusability for most of the implemented classes,
    such as `Person`, `Event`, `AddressBook`, `AppointmentBook` and `UniqueElementList`.
    For instance, we can reuse the `Person` class to derive classes which can represent patients or staff doctors.
    Likewise, the `Event` class can be used to derive classes which can represent patient's appointments and staff duty shifts.

* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

* does not depend on any of the other three components.





* stores a unique list of `Tags` and `ReferenceId`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.

The `QueueManager`,

* stores a `QueueList` object that represents the queue.
* stores a `UniqueElementList<Room>` which represents a list of consultation rooms where staff doctors are stationed.

[[Design-QueueManager]]
.Structure of the QueueManager Component

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagramV2.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save and read data of the Address Book in json format.
* can save and read data of the Appointment Book data in json format.
* able to reuse `JsonAddressBookStorage` to store the details of doctors and patients.
* able to reuse `JsonAppointmentBookStorage` to store the details of staff duty shifts and patient's appointments.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::autocomplete[]

=== AutoComplete

We are using Prefix Tree which is known as a Trie for AutoComplete. This gives us a worst case time complexity of O(m), where m is length of the search string. While the space complexity is O(bm), where b is number of unique alphabets used, m is length of longest word stored.

image::AutoCompleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

// end::autocomplete[]

=== Queue feature
The queue feature allows the user to enqueue and dequeue a patient from the queue.

* e.g. `enqueue 003A` - Enqueues the patient with reference id 003A.
* e.g. `next 1` Serves the next patient in queue and allocates him/her to room 1.

==== Current Implementation
The queue will be displayed in a list.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an enqueue command:

image::EnqueueActivityDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a next command:

image::NextActivityDiagram.png[]

Below is an example usage of the queue feature.

Step 1: User enters the `enqueue E0000001A` command.

Step 2: The command then calls Model#enqueuePatient to enqueue the patient into the queue.

Step 3: Patient will then be showed in the queue.

=== Appointment feature
The Appointment feature provides users with the ability to manage appointments for patients. It can help patients to add, change, or delete appointments. It also helps the user to keep track of the missed appointments.

* e.g. `addappt i/001A str/01/11/19 1800 rec/m num/2` - allows the user to schedule two reoccurring monthly appointments for the patient whose reference Id is 001A.
* e.g. `changeappt 1 str/02/11/19 1800` - allows the user to change a patient's first appointment timing to be the input timing if there is no conflict.

==== Current Implementation
The Appointment feature contains multiple operations to indirectly manipulate the UniqueAppointmentList. The implemented operations include:

`addappt` Command - Adds a appointment or recursive appointments to a patient.

`ackappt` Command - Acknowledges a appointment once the patient reaches.

`appointments` Command - Lists all upcoming appointment schedule or lists a specific patient's upcoming appointments.

`changeappt` Command - Change a current appointment's timing to a different timing.

`cancelappt` Command - Cancels appointments found within the appointment schedule.

`missappt` Command - Lists all missing appointment.

`settleappt` Command - Settles a missing appointment when user contact with patient.


The class diagram below illustrates the interactions between the Appointment class and associated classes.

.Appointment class diagram
image::AppointmentClassDiagram.png[]

Each Appointment object consists of a PatientId, Timing, Status. Timing class has 2 DateTime object as they indicates the starting and ending time of the appointment. The UniqueAppointmentList contains 0 or more Appointments.

The current implementation of Appointment will do check with patient object by the unique referenceId and it will also check timing with doctors' dutyRoster. If the referenceId exists within the Model#UniquePatientList and the timing is valid, then constructing the Appointment object. This ensures that the patient is registered and the appointment's timing is valid before making an appointment.

==== `addappt` Command
The addAppointment command behaves similarly to the add command used for Patient and Doctor. The command takes in the parameters required to construct ReferenceId, DateTime and Status. The image below shows how the Appointment object is constructed.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a AddAppointment command:

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component when a user executes a `addappt` command
image::AddAppointmentActivityDiagram.png[]

==== `ackappt` command

The ackAppointment command will mark the patient's the most upcoming appointment as Acknowledge when the patient is reaching and it will updateUniqueAppointmentList to display the rest appointments that are belong to the patient.

==== `appointments` Command

The appointments command works in two different cases for different purpose.

Case 1: `appointments patientId`

The appointments command searches for appointments that were belong to the patient that was entered by the user. The filtered appointments are found in ModelManager. The list is instantiated by filtering the UniqueAppointmentList using EventContainsKeywordPredicate which is created from the patientId argument supplied by the user.

Case 2: `appointments`

The appointments behaves similarly to appointments with the exception that it does not take in any arguments. Instead, it automatically executes with the predicate EventContainsApprovedStatusPredicate. updateFilteredAppointmentList() is called and the entire list of upcoming appointments is shown to the user.

==== `changeappt` Command
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a ChangeAppointment command:

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component when a user executes a `changeappt` command

image::ChangeAppointmentActivityDiagram.png[]

==== `cancelappt` Command

`cancelappt` simply takes in the index of the target appointment to cancel according to the displayed appointment list.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("cancelappt 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `cancelappt 1` Command
image::CancelAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== `missappt` Command

The missAppointment command searches for appointments that patients did not come. The filtered appointments are found in ModelManager. The list is instantiated by filtering the UniqueAppointmentList using EventsMissedPredicate which checks all APPROVED-Status appointments' ending times with current time.

==== `settleappt` Command

The settleAppointment command helps users to record if they settled missing appointments. It allows users make any missing appointment to be SETTLE once users have settled it. it will updateUniqueAppointmentList to display the rest missing appointments.

In future implementations, i.e. v2.0, the valid timing slot will be given after checking with doctor's dutyRoster and Model#UniqueAppointmentList. This ensures users can easily make appointments for patients.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect:  How to store Timing fields

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create DateTime and Timing class to store
** Pros: Makes it easier to calculate timings and clashes between multiple appointments with different timing field.
** Cons: Requires additional code to implement Timing class and interact with other common methods that rely on DateTime.
* **Alternative 2:** Store as Strings
** Pros: Makes it easier to implement.
** Cons: Requires additional code to convert into DateTIme class when carrying out calculating methods.

===== Aspect: display appointments

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display appointments in a tab
** Pros: Creates an intuitive and easily navigable screen to display appointments.
** Cons: Decreases the efficiency of CLI by having to use GUI inputs.
* **Alternative 2:** Keeps the onscreen clutter at a minimum and stays in line with the CLI concept.
** Pros: Makes it easier to implement.
** Cons: Increases difficulty in freely accessing appointments.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
